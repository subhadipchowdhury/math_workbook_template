# Math Workbook Template

A versatile template for writing Math notes, worksheets and homework assignments.  

This version uses the book class and chapters to create longer notes.

See assignments/sampleassignment.tex for usage of worksheet option.

I recommend using Overleaf to compile sample.tex. If using an offline compiler, remember to run biber.
